Bus Management System
In our Semester Project for Enterprise Application Development I built this Bus Management System using WPF (Desktop Development Technology) and Entity Framework(To work with sql database) . So in this project there are 3 roles 
Guard
Admin
Super Admin

Guard can Enter a vehicle and exit a vehicle Its time would be Automatically Inserted in Database First it will be checked if vehicle is registered or not then next process will take place
Admin can perform CRUD operation to Guard profile as well as Registered Vehicles It can also generate reports by filtering options that are provided to him and can also download report into an Excel File
Super Admin cannot only perform Admin tasks but also can perform CRUD operation to Admin Profile
